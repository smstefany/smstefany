- 👋 Hi, I’m @smstefany
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web Development Projects
- 📫 How to reach me on my LinkedIn Link highlighted on my profile
- 😄 Pronouns: Her/She
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that...
   the first web page ever created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 is still accessible online today?
   Just like that pioneering step of connecting the world through the web, developing web applications gives me the same rush—the dopamine hit of seeing my code come to life,
   doing exactly what I tell it to!
